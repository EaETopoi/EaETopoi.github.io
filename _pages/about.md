Hi! My name is E or Ea (pronounced like "Ae-uh", where "Ae" is like in "Fae" and "uh" is like in "bug"), they/it/she, and I'm a trans mathematics student in the second year of my PhD at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.  My current research interests are varied but lie among the following, and connections therein: <img align="right" src="images/Ace.jpg" alt="Ace!" style="width:200px; height:auto; border: solid 1px #CCC" hspace="20px"/>

- Virtual double category theory
- Homotopy theory and Higher Algebra
- Topos Theory
- Medical imaging
- Shape analysis (in relation to biological imaging)

A little about me: I'm passionate about equitable and accessible math and science outreach; I'm passionate about anti-racism, disability justice, and intersectional feminism as a whole, especially as it pertains to STEM; I enjoy bouldering and crocheting in my free time; I'm an ex-children's gymnastics coach; and I have an incredibly cute dog named Ace!
