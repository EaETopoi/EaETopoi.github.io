Hi! My name is E or Ea (pronounced like ey-ah), they/them, and I'm a trans mathematics student starting a PhD at UIUC in the fall.  My current research interests are varied but lie among the following, and connections therein:
- (higher) Category Theory
- Homotopy theory
- Topos Theory
- Algebraic geometry
- Inverse problems
- Riemannian geometry
- Medical imaging
- Shape analysis (in relation to biological imaging)
A little about me: I'm an ex-national gymnast and ex-children's gymnastics coach; I'm passionate about equitable and accessible math and science outreach; I'm passionate about anti-racism, disability justice, and intersectional feminism as a whole, especially as it pertains to STEM; and I have an incredibly cute dog ([Fig. 1](Ace-fig)) named Ace!
