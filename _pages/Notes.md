Below are a collection of mathematical notes I have written for a variety of purposes related to my own learning and to assisting in the learning of others.


## Lecture Notes

* <a href="/files/Math627_GrothendieckTopoiAndTheEtaleSite.pdf" class="image fit">Grothendieck Topoi and Sites</a>, lecture notes accompanying a special lecture for the Pacific Institute of Mathematics (PIMS) course on geometry and arithmetic of schemes.

## Expository Notes

* <a href="/files/Math501_FinalProject_PontryaginDuality (2).pdf" class="image fit">Building Fourier Analysis for Groups Through Duality</a>, a paper on Pontryagin Duality for the final project of Math 501: Measure and Integration at the University of Calgary.
* <a href="/files/Math617Paper_E_Ea.pdf" class="image fit">Abstract Algebras of Observables and their Concrete
Models: The Gelfand-Naimark-Segal Construction</a>, a paper on the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal Construction and its relation to the operator perspective for quantum mechanics, completed for the final project of Math 617: Functional Analysis at the University of Calgary.
* <a href="/files/AnalysisIIPaper.pdf" class="image fit">The Projective Structure of Quantum Mechanics</a>, a paper on the structure of projective spaces and their appearance in certain geometric models of quantum mechanics, completed for the final project of Math 445: Analysis II at the University of Calgary.
